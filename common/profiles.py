"""
Resource-profile switcher — the *session* layer (F-1).

The spark-dev curriculum reproduces big-data failure modes at small scale by
(1) shrinking the box and (2) toggling Spark's safety nets. There are two layers:

  • Container / box size  — `spark.driver.memory` + container `mem_limit`. Fixed when
    the Docker server boots, so it's flipped at startup, NOT here:
        make up              # tuned       (~3 GB box, driver 2g, all cores)
        make up-constrained  # constrained (~2 GB box, driver 1g, 2 cores)  ← OOM/spill modules
    A Spark Connect client cannot change the server's heap at runtime, so memory-bound
    pathologies (executor/driver OOM, heavy spill) need the constrained *box*.

  • Session safety nets   — AQE, skew-join, broadcast threshold, shuffle partitions.
    These ARE runtime SQL confs, settable per session over Spark Connect — that's THIS
    module. Most pathology modules (e.g. SPK-1 skew) force the broken behavior with the
    `constrained` profile, then relieve it with `tuned`, all without restarting the server.

Usage in a notebook:
    from common.spark_session import spark
    from common.profiles import apply_profile, profile_summary

    apply_profile(spark, "constrained")   # AQE off, broadcast off → force the pathology
    # ... run the broken query, read the Spark UI ...

    apply_profile(spark, "tuned")          # AQE on, skew-join on → watch it heal
    # ... or apply a manual fix (salting) and compare with metrics_diff ...

    profile_summary(spark)                 # print the knobs currently in effect
